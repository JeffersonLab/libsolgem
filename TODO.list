TO-DO list for GEP tracking at 12 GeV2, with realistic background levels.
Do not hesitate to update and complete, if needed, this list.


> - Modify/rewrite libsolgem for Cartesian geometry
 => DONE.

 => DONE

> - Modify TSolSimEvent and TSolSimDecoder data structures for SBS, if
> necessary. (Might be ok, but could be optimized.)
 => TO-DO ? Is it necessary ?

> - Modify TSolSimDecoder to understand the SBS geometry.
 => TO-DO

> - Write databases for libsolgem (now libsbsgem?) TSolSimDecoder (cratemap)
 => TO-DO

> - Write a database for TreeSearch-GEM matching the one used for the
simulation and the digitization. For SoLID, I wrote a special program
called dbconvert to do this: it can be found in the TreeSearch repo on
the SoLID branch. Obviously, it assumes a cylindrical geometry.
 => TO-DO



> - Analysis code for the second arm of the SBS experiment(s) to be
> studied, e.g. the CD/ECAL combination.
 => TO-DO

> - Code (special analyzer?) to perform the kinematic correlation analysis
> between electron and proton arm, defining a region of interest
 => TO-DO

> - Code to import the region of interest from the previous calculation
> into TreeSearch.
 => TO-DO
